# Analyzing_healthcare_data_for_insights_and_patterns

Problem Description:
Healthcare data analysis is an important application of data science that can provide insights
and patterns for healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers. With the increasing
availability of healthcare data, it has become possible to use data-driven approaches to
improve the quality of care, reduce costs, and better understand diseases and their treatments.
In this project, we aim to analyze healthcare data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that
can be used to improve patient outcomes and healthcare operations.
